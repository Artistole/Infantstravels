                <div style="display:block;width: 60%;height: 300px;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;"><img src="../../places/Religious/Mathura/images/dwarkadhish-temple-mathura-header.jpg">
                </div>
                <div></div>
                <p>Dwarkadheesh Temple, one of the most popular religious places to visit in Mathura, was built by Seth Gokul Das, the treasurer of what was then the Gwalior estate in 1814. He received hefty donations for this purpose from Shrimant Daulat
                    Rao Scindia, the Maharaja of Gwalior.</p>
                <p>The first thing that catches your attention at the Dwarkadheesh Temple in Mathura is its architecture, which bears a strong resemblance to the havelis of Rajasthan. The largest and oldest of all temples in Mathura, Uttar Pradesh, it is
                    one of the most important pilgrimage sites for Hindus in India and holds a special religious significance for millions.</p>
                <p>The temple’s enormous facade, with its arched getaway and latticed windows, is hard to miss. To reach it, you need to make your way through the din and bustle of a bazaar, which itself is quite popular with shoppers. Most of the shops
                    here contain shringaar (decorative items and dresses for God) that devotees purchase on their way to the temple. The chanting of mantras “Hare Krishna” and “Radhe Radhe” fills the air. Dwarkadheesh Temple, one of the most famous temples
                    in India, is dedicated to Lord Dwarkadheesh, who is a form of Lord Krishna.</p>
                <p>Today, the temple is administered by the followers of Vallabhacharya, a renowned Hindu philosopher and theologian. Its stately exteriors certainly give a message of its being a residence for kings and noble beings. Come into the interiors
                    though, and the magnificence of its exteriors seems to recede into the background. There are two entrance gates of the temple which are built in traditional Rajasthani style. A flight of stairs take you to the courtyard of the temple.
                    From here, you can watch the two-storied temple in all its beauty. Entry to the upper floor, is restricted to visitors.</p>
                <p>The main deities of Dwarkadheesh Temple, are Dwarkadheesh (Lord Krishna) and Radha Rani. These are installed on the ground floor. On the railings of the second floor, you can find paintings depicting Lord Krishna’s childhood tales, including
                    his birth and mischief (leela) with his companions (gopikas). Other paintings can be found on its walls on the ground floor.</p>
                <p>
                    It is during the shringar aarti that the temple overflows with visitors. However, before the commencement of the aarti, various rituals are followed. One of these is the drawing of curtains over the sanctum followed by the dressing of the main deity.
                    The clothes and colours which are selected for Lord Krishna are yellow kurta and blue dhoti, as these are his favourites. Besides this, he is also decked with ornaments followed by the spraying of perfumed water. After this ritual,
                    the curtains are opened to enthusiastic chantings of “Jai Shri Krishna”. The sight of Lord Krishna is his colourful costumes, flanked by his queens, Satyabhama and Rukmini, brings a smile on the faces of the devotees.</p>
                <p>After a while, the Shringar Aarti begins, much to the delight of devotees. Priests and devotees sing the aarti in unison, creating a soothing aura. At the same time that the aarti commences, the priests hold a mirror to Lord Krishna’s
                    statue as it is considered to be auspicious to show him his reflection. It is also an important part of the ritual.</p>

                <h3>Gita Mandir</h3>
                <img src="../../places/Religious/Mathura/images/gita-mandir-mathura.jpg">
                <p>Birla Mandir, also known as Gita Mandir, is located on the outskirts of Mathura on the Mathura-Vrindavan road. All throughout India, Birla Mandirs have become famous for their grandiose design and architecture and are prominent landmarks
                    wherever they are constructed. This grand temple, which is one of the most famous temples in Mathura, was built by Jugal Kishore Birla. His devotion to Laxmi Narayana (an avatar of Lord Vishnu) and his eternal song, Bhagwat Gita, inspired
                    him to build the temple. It is called Gita Temple because its main room is adorned with all the verses of the Gita. The depictions of Arjuna along with his friend and guide Krishna, in a chariot, is inspiring and delightful.</p>
                <p>Turn your attention to its architecture though, and you see a curious amalgamation of Hindu and Western styles of architecture. Built in red sandstone, this popular temple in Mathura announces its stately presence quite noticeably. There
                    are two incredible marble structures which are major attractions in this temple. One is the Gita Stambh (Pillar) and the other is Hanuman Temple. The Gita Stambh, or the Victory Tower as it is also called, is built from red sandstone.
                    On it are inscribed the entire sacred teachings of Bhagavad Gita, the eternal source of wisdom for mankind. The verses have been inscribed with sharp precision, with each letter as discernible as the other. It is an inspiring sight
                    to come across.</p>

                <img src="../../places/Religious/Mathura/images/103055465Mathura_Krishna_Janmabhoomi_Temple_Main.jpg">
                <p>At a distance of 4 km from Mathura Junction Railway Station, Sri Krishna Janmabhoomi is the most famous temple located in the crowded city of Mathura. The temple is the most important site for the followers of Lord Krishna and Hindus as
                    a whole.
                </p>
                <p>Sri Krishna Janma Bhoomi also known as Katra Keshav Dev temple, is the actual birthplace of Lord Krishna. A bigger temple was constructed to replace the old temple during the reign of Emperor Chandragupta Vikramaditya (4th century CE).
                    This temple used to one of the grandest temples in India until it was destroyed by Ghazni Mahmud in 11th century. In 1150 AD, Jajja during the rule of Vijay Pal Deva rebuilt the temple but the temple was destructed by other Muslim
                    ruler Sikandar Lodi in 16th century. The fourth temple was built during the rule of Mughal emperor Jahangir by Veer Singh Bundela of Orchaa. But it was again destroyed by Aurangzeb in 1669 AD and a mosque named Jami Masjid was built
                    in the place of the temple.
                </p>
                <p>According to the devotees visiting the temple, getting a Darshan of the long haired Krishna brings about the fulfilment of a wish. As you approach the temple, you cannot but help feel a divine connection, as if the entire place was blessed
                    by the presence of Lord Krishna himself. You are overcome by an array of emotions, and seeing devotees with tears in their eyes is not an unusual sight here.

                </p>
                <p>The history of the Keshav Dev Temple is as fascinating as Lord Krishna’s childhood antics, which are so loved by everybody. According to mythological sources, this temple was first built by Vajranabha, the great grandson of Krishna, about
                    5,000 years back. However, if a particular sanskrit inscription is to be believed, a new temple was built on this very site under the rule of Maharaja Vijayapal Deva. Another source states that it was again rebuilt under the rule of
                    Chandragupta Vikramaditya of the Gupta Empire. Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, the famous Bhakti-era saint and mystic, is said to have visited the temple in the 16th century. The temple underwent further construction under Raja Veer Singh Bundela
                    of Orchha during the rule of Jahangir.</p>

                    Sri Krishna used to play the flute sitting on the brunch of a Kadamba tree. This sacred Vishram Ghat is popular among the devotees as Sri Radha used to come here to collect water from the river Yamuna and also spend a delightful time
                    with Sri Krishna. It is a bathing Ghat where the devotees of Sri Krishna come to take a holy dip in the river Yamuna. There are a total 25 Ghats in Mathura and the Vishram Ghat is the biggest and the most famous among them.</p>

                <p>It was constructed by the Jat rulers of the Bharatpur. Maharaja Suraj Mal constructed the sarovar and garden for his queen Kishori Rani.[citation needed] The building, with cenotaphs of the Bharatpur royal family, was built by Maharaja
                    Jawahir Singh, the king of Bharatpur (1707–1763), in honor of his father MahaRaja Suraj Mall in 1764. Members of his family died during the 18th century fighting the British.[1] It is named for the Kilakinchita Lila legend about female
                    cow herders (gopis) who picked flowers for offerings to the Sun God, Surya Deva for the nearby Surya Deva Temple and met with Krishna and his friend Madhumangala, who vanish and disguise themselves as priests and accept the flowers
                    and sweets at the temple. Sarovar means lake and kusum means flowers.</p>
